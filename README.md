## About this Project

This Expense Tracker App was developed for the purpose of learning React. It is 
a place where I can experiment and see where the boundaries are. However, 
I wanted something I would actually use, and I've been wanting a simple tool to 
enter the purchases I make and analyze the data to see what I could learn from it. 

At present this app does not connect to any database, etc. Each page has its own 
set of mock data used for development purposes. Consequently, changes you make on 
one page won't be reflected in another. Eventually, it will connect to the 
expense-tracker-api. 

I have worked with Java Server Faces and Apache Wicket for many years. My approach 
to React is, therefore, drawn from that experience. My approach to conversion and 
validation, in particular, is patterned after the way they are handled in JSF and 
Wicket.
